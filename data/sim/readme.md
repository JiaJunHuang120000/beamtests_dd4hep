* muon data are produced with 4 GeV going straight through the center 
  prototype detector, no energy or angle spread (geometry/mu-_steering.py)
* electron data simulates the actually beam test condition, 4 GeV electron beam,
  20 mm above, no energy spread, angle spreads from -0.04 to 0.04 (geometry/steering.py)
